# Host transport revisions

Every enabled texture channel exposes a monotonically increasing content
revision through `TextureChannels::channel_revision`. Each logical tile stores
the channel revision at which that tile most recently changed, readable through
`TextureChannels::tile_revision`. Both calls inspect metadata only: they do not
allocate a sparse tile or read pixel bytes.

CPU writes compare the incoming pixel bytes with the current value. A real byte
change advances the channel sequence once and assigns that value to the affected
tile. Writing the same value is a no-op, so polling hosts do not observe false
changes. Other tiles and channels retain their prior revisions.

Revision zero denotes unchanged initial channel content. Exhausting the 64-bit
sequence refuses the write rather than wrapping to a misleading value. Task 8.2
builds the coalesced delta history over this sequence; snapshot lifetime,
residency and asynchronous readback remain separate later transport tasks.
